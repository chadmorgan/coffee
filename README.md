# Coffee brewing experiments

*April - May 2020:* After playing around in an informal way with how I brew my morning coffee trying to get a better result, I had the idea to do a proper experiment to see if I can find a better combination of variables.

There are many variables that I could change, but I decided to focus on the following four and keep the others as fixed as possible:

- grind size:
  - fine: 3 on my grinder
  - coarse: 16 on my grinder
- grams of coffee: 10 or 20
- water temp: 175F or 200F
- steeping time: 30sec or 60sec

My brewing procedure, which I tried to keep consistent:

0. Use R to randomly sample an experimental run from the design
1. Measure out beans in grams
2. Grind beans in my electric burr grinder with chosen grind size
3. Heat water in my electric kettle to the required temperature
4. Set up aeropress for inverted brewing (so I can control steep time better)
5. Put ground coffee in aeropress, set on scale and tare it
6. Pour 170 grams of heated water in aeropress
7. Start timer
8. Give a few good stirs
9. When time is up, invert and press into mug
10. Clean up, making sure to brush any coffee dust out of the grinder chamber

While drinking, I rated each coffee on a few measurements using a 0-10 scale:
- Acidity
- Bitterness
- Overall enjoyment
